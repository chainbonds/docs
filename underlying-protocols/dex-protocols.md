# ðŸ’± DEX Protocols

Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) include different mechanisms to generate yields for liquidity providers. &#x20;

Whenever a user (Alice) makes a trade on a decentralized exchange, she pays a constant percentage of the traded volume as a fee. In most protocols, this fee is between 0.5% and 0.02% of the traded volume. This does not include things like slippage, and the spread.&#x20;

As with most markets, exchanges requires liquidity to function. As such, the decentralized exchange incentivizes another party (Bob), to provide liquidity. If Bob is the only liquidity provider in this market, Bob receives the full trading fee that Alice had to pay. In other words, if Bob is the only liquidity provider in this market, for most exchanges Bob receives between 0.5% and 0.02% of the volume that Alice traded.&#x20;

There are a vast number of decentralized exchanges on Solana. Some includes:

* [Saber](https://saber.so) which includes cross-chain stablecoin and wrapped assets.
* [Invariant](https://invariant.app) which provides the concentrated liquidity, lowering slippage and trading fees drastically.
* [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org) (on Ethereum) which is currently the number one decentralized crypto trading protocol.
* [Project Serum](https://www.projectserum.com) which brings speed and convenience of centralized exchange to decentralized exchanges, through their central limit orderbook (CLOB) model.

In our currently Iteration, we only include Saber stablepools. We deposit only the pair that you have paid in, removing the problem of impermanent loss.&#x20;

We plan to soon also include other projects too, however.
