# Other Protocols

Other protocols include options protocols, leverage-farming protocols, and combinations between the protocols above. Due to our focus on risk-averse assets, we do not combine different assets into one strategy. This may change, however, according to your needs, so please let us know!&#x20;

We currently do not consider protocols that are not listed within the DEX protocols, Lending & Borrowing Protocols or Staking Protocols Tabs.
