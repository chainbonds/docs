# ðŸ¥© Staking Protocols

Staking Protocols include different mechanisms to generate yields for liquidity providers. &#x20;

Depending on the type of the blockchain, the underlying logic of the staking protocol is based on a different token. When you stake on Solana, you receive SOL tokens. When you stake on Ethereum, you receive ETH tokens. When you stake on Terra, you receive LUNA tokens.&#x20;

Different protocols introduced the concept of liquid staking, where you can conveniently stake your assets by swapping them at a constant ratio with the staked derivative.&#x20;

For example, Alice, who has 103.5 SOL, can swap it against 100 marinade SOL, which is a wrapped, liquid-staking token on Solana.&#x20;

There are a vast number of borrow & lending protocols on Solana and beyond. Some include:

* [Marinade Finance](https://marinade.finance) which automatically chooses the staking validator such as to best decentralize the Solana network&#x20;
* [Socean Finance](https://www.socean.fi) which also automatically chooses the staking validator such as to best decentralize the Solana network, allowing for best yields and instant stake and unstaking
* [Lido Finance](https://lido.fi) which works together with a number of validator pools and staking facilities to offer liquid staking tokens for a number of protocols, including Terra, Ethereum, Kusama and Solana&#x20;

In our current iteration we do not implement any Staking Protocols.&#x20;
