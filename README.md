# ðŸ‘‹ What is qPools?

### Introduction

**qPools is a portfolio-building toolkit** with the following properties:

* **non-custodial:** __ qPools never manages or owns assets of you. All your assets are stored on PDAs, so you are the only one who holds power over your assets.
* **passive-income / yield-generating assets:** All the assets that qPools allows you to invest in are yield-generating. This means that you don't just store wETH, for example, but that the wETH that you store is stored into one yield-generating pool (i.e. staking, or borrow-lending).&#x20;
* **transparent and convenient:** We make it simple and convenient to deposit assets into our protocol. You can select what yield-generating protocols you want to deposit your assets, and we present you with the APY and volatility statistics for each of these assets. Our go-to-strategy optimizes for Sharpe ratio and is volatility-adjusted for adequate safety for the common user.&#x20;

Our vision is to connect the liquidity across the entire ecosystem, and make it accessible through one unified interface.

### Where does the yield stem from?

The yield is accumulated from providing liquidity on different platforms deployed on Solana. You can find a more detailed information under the underlying protocols section but the resources of the yields are mainly trading fees, interest rates from lending the funds, or staking the funds in a validator network.

### Who are we serving?

qPools aims to serve individuals who want to participate in DeFi, wallet providers who want to allow their end-users to conveniently participate in DeFi, DAO and project reserves that want to utilize a portfolio-mechanism, while generating passive income, as well as more traditional players such as Family Offices, VCs, Hedge Fund and Banks, who want to also participate in the DeFi asset class, for sake of yield generation or diversification. All these actors are considered liquidity providers.

On the other side, if the liquidity provided by the actors above is parked in yield-generating protocols, such as staking protocols, borrow & lending protocols, as well as liquidity mining protocols.&#x20;



#### one unifying protocol&#x20;

qPools is a unifying platform for a multitude of protocols. We offer a fully customizable allocation platform, where you can reach a manifold of assets with their corresponding APY values and potential risks. You can manage all your assets with ease on our platform.

#### allocate in according to risk

Are you a risk averse person, but still want to take advantage of high yields available in crypto-space ? Or, do you want to take more risk in return of potential greater earnings ? You just need to indicate how risky your portfolio should be, and we allocate your capital in according to your risk profile.

#### sharpe ratio

We calculate periodically the Sharpe Ratio of the products in our portfolio to offer our clients an allocation strategy that maximizes the yields while minimizing the risk.
