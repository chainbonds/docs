# ðŸ‘‹ What is qPools?

**qPools is a non-custodial, passive-income portfolio-building toolkit on Solana with the vision of connecting the liquidity across the entire ecosystem.**

Compared to traditional portfolio-building protocols, the underlying assets and protocols that qPools connect to are protocols from the realm of decentralized finance, which generate passive income.&#x20;

The passive income is accumulated from providing liquidity on different platforms deployed on Solana. You can find a more detailed information under the underlying protocols section but the resources of the yields are mainly trading fees, interest rates from lending the funds, or staking the funds in a validator network.



#### one unifying protocol&#x20;

qPools is a unifying platform for a multitude of protocols. We offer a fully customizable allocation platform, where you can reach a manifold of assets with their corresponding APY values and potential risks. You can manage all your assets with ease on our platform.

#### allocate in according to risk

Are you a risk averse person, but still want to take advantage of high yields available in crypto-space ? Or, do you want to take more risk in return of potential greater earnings ? You just need to indicate how risky your portfolio should be, and we allocate your capital in according to your risk profile.

#### sharpe ratio

We calculate periodically the Sharpe Ratio of the products in our portfolio to offer our clients an allocation strategy that maximizes the yields while minimizing the risk.



## Our Vision

The growing number of products in the DeFi space has caused liquidity to be fragmented over many AMMs, rather than concentrating liquidity around established and efficient products such as the Serum order-book. With qPools, we provide liquidity to several DEXs and strengthen the ecosystem.





(1) What is qPools? qPools provides passive income using decentralized finance protocols. In other words, qPools is a yield-aggregator, that also considers risk (in terms volatility). We speak of "portfolios" when allocating USDC (or SOL) to a given number of asset. Our devpost covers our idea most concisely, check it out! [https://devpost.com/software/qpools](https://devpost.com/software/qpools)&#x20;



(2) What underlying assets are you using right now? Right now we are focusing on liquidity pools on Saber. We intend to scale (a) the number of pools, and once that's done, also (b) scale to other protocols.&#x20;



(3) Do we do NFTs? Short answer is: Yes. Long answer: We are still in the process of building our product. Given that our NFTs should have utility, based on the product that we're building, we need to first make sure that our product is something people want. As such, our priority is mostly on the product. We are looking into different NFT mechanisms already, however. If you have any ideas, or other dope projects we should know about, put them into the ðŸš€-nft-launch channel!&#x20;



(4) I want to invest in the qPools project. When are you raising funds? If you are an investor, VC or fund, please e-mail contact@qpools.finance or DM @David | qPools on discord or write us on twitter. We are currently not focusing on fundraising, but getting to know people is always good in this space.
