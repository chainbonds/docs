# ‚ùì FAQ

### 1. What is qPools?&#x20;

qPools provides passive income using decentralized finance protocols. In other words, qPools is a yield-aggregator, that also considers risk (in terms volatility). We speak of "portfolios" when allocating USDC (or SOL) to a given number of asset. Although already strongly outdated, our devpost covers our idea most concisely, check it out!

### 2. What yield-generating assets are you using right now?&#x20;

Right now we are focusing on liquidity pools on Saber. We intend to scale (a) the number of pools, and once that's done, also (b) scale to other protocols.&#x20;



### 3. Do we do NFTs?&#x20;

Short answer is: Yes. Long answer: We are still in the process of building our product. Given that our NFTs should have utility, based on the product that we're building, we need to first make sure that our product is something people want. As such, our priority is mostly on the product. We are looking into different NFT mechanisms already, however. If you have any ideas, or other dope projects we should know about, put them into the üöÄ-nft-launch channel!&#x20;



### 4. When are you raising funds?&#x20;

If you are an investor, VC or fund, please e-mail contact@qpools.finance or DM @David | qPools on discord or write us on twitter. We are currently not focusing on fundraising, but getting to know people is always good in this space.
