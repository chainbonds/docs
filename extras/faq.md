# ‚ùì FAQ

Too lazy to read everything? TL;DR right here!

### 1) What is qPools?&#x20;

qPools is a portfolio building toolkit. It provides passive income using a number of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Specifically, it provides information on yield (APY), as well as volatility and risk.&#x20;

As such, qPools can also be considered as a yield-aggregator, that also considers risk in terms volatility.&#x20;

### 2) What protocols are you integrating with?&#x20;

Right now we are focusing on liquidity pools on Saber. We intend to scale (a) the number of pools, and once that's done, also (b) scale to other protocols to also include Lending & Borrowing, and Staking Protocols.&#x20;

### 3) Do we do NFTs?&#x20;

The short answer is: **Yes!**

The long answer is:&#x20;

We are still in the process of building our product. Given that our NFTs should have utility, based on the product that we're building, we need to first make sure that our product is something people want. As such, our priority is mostly on the product.&#x20;
