# ðŸ§— Risks

Risks include:

### Smart contract risks

A smart contract is a piece of program that is executed on its corresponding block-chain. Smart contracts bring several benefits like decentralization and transparency and saves us from the need to rely on 3rd party intermediaries. qPools and the underlying protocols that we use to generate yields utilize smart contracts to offer those benefits to our customers.

Like any other programs, smart contracts are also prone to the bugs, which can result in unintended behavior of the program. This might mean in some cases losses in the capital. As soon a the developer team becomes aware of the bug or any security leak, they make the best effort to fix the issue.

### Price Risks
