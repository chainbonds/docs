# ðŸ—º Roadmap

What are we working on right now?

### 1 Launch to Mainnet

We are currently focused to launching to mainnet as soon as possible. The difficult functionality is to be able to keep a portfolio without letting the user approve every single transaction. Rather, the user should be able to approve only (1) deciding where to deposit the funds to and (2) depositing the funds to the Portfolio PDA. After this is working, and we have tested this thrughouly, we will launch to mainnet.

We will start iterating on customer feedback as much as possible after this first mainnet launch.

### 2 NFT Minting

After our mainnet launch, we intend to design and do a NFT minting process, similar to the Lfinity.io flares, where our NFTs carry utility through a game that every NFT holder participates in. More details coming soon!
