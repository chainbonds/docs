# ðŸ§— Risks & Security

Currently there is a number of risks that you should know about when using the qPools toolkit. Please take note however, that these are standard risks that most DeFi protocols have.&#x20;



### qPools Smart Contract Risks

A smart contract is a piece of program that is executed on its corresponding block-chain. Smart contracts bring several benefits like decentralization and transparency, and saves us from the need to rely on 3rd party intermediaries. qPools utilize smart contracts to offer those benefits to our customers.

Like any other programs, smart contracts are also prone to the bugs, which can result in unintended behaviour of the program. This might mean in some cases partial or complete losses of assets. As soon a the developer team becomes aware of the bug or any security leak, we make the best and fastest effort to fix the issue. Once we have additional funds both in our pools, as well as capital to afford it, we will also purchase audits from companies such as Neodyme or Soteria.&#x20;



### Third Party Smart Contract Risks

qPools deposits assets into underlying protocols to generate yields. These underlying protocols, also third party protocols, are also exposed to smart contract risk. We do make sure that any protocols and assets we use are reputable, open-source and are well-used.

### Price Risks (only when Swapping)

Crypto-assets in general are exposed to market fluctuations. In our portfolio building toolkit, you can&#x20;

The value of your wallet might change due to price variances and other external factors.&#x20;



## Additional Security Mechanisms

The portfolio of any two independent users never shares assets. Although qPools is non-custodian, none of the assets is pooled into a common pool.&#x20;
