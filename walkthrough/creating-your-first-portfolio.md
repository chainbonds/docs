# ðŸ“Š Creating your first Portfolio

Coming Soon! The current text is v0.1. There are a couple of dimensions in which you can do that:&#x20;

### Swapping to Other Assets

1. You can deposit your USDC, and ask for your assets to not be swapped into any other assets. This way, qPools recommends you the yield-generating protocols that maximize your APY for the USDC that you provided, without swapping your USDC into any other assets.
2. You can deposit your USDC; and ask for part of your assets to be swapped into other assets. This way, qPools recommends you the yield-generating protocols that maximize your APY for the USDC, including any other assets which may also be maximizing the yield. As part of your USDC is swapped into other assets, this may exposes you to the risk of impermanent loss.

### **Selecting Protocols**

You can select which protocols to deposit into. While we suggest you a risk-minimizing strategy, you can freely edit it to exclude any protocols that you don't want to deposit your assets into.&#x20;

### **Selecting Allocation Percentages**

While our strategy is just a recommendation, you can decide how much should be put into each pool. You can deposit your assets into pools in such a way to mirror your assets in your wallet.&#x20;

### Supported Wallets

Phantom is our preferred wallet, and it is the wallet that we test our application most on. The plugin we use also support the Sollet and Solflare Wallets.
