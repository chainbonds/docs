Are you a risk lower that has eyes on the highest yields ? You can distribute your capital aiming for the best APY just with one click.

### Convenient passive income

You may have some assets, like stablecoins like USDC laying around in your wallet. Instead of letting them just sit there, you can deposit them into qPools. You can choose if you want exposure to other assets, or keep everything in this e.g. stablecoin. You can enjoy withdraw your assets at any time with no early-withdrawal fee involved.

### Make your wallet-assets work for you

You may have some assets in your wallet, and you might want to generate passive income using these assets. You may not know what the best combination of these assets is, however. In this case, you can use our `deposit everything in the wallet` functionality to let qPools find the configuration that maximizes APY while minimizing volatility.&#x20;

### Keep a Portfolio, while generating passive income

Generally, when you create a portfolio, similar to an index or an ETF, your assets are dispersed all over. You might even have to pay management fees or profit fees to keep the portfolio. Using qPools, you can let go of management fees. In fact, your portfolio generates passive income for you.&#x20;
